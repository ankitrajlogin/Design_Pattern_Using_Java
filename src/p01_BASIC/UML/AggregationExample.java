What is Aggregation?
Aggregation is a type of association in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).
It represents a "Has-A" relationship between two classes.
One class is a container (whole), and another is a part (contained).
In aggregation, the contained object can exist independently of the container object.
ðŸ‘‰ In UML, Aggregation is shown with a hollow diamond (â—‡).


Department â—‡â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Teacher
Department (whole) aggregates Teacher (part).
But Teacher can exist independently of Department.


Real-Life Example
A Department has Teachers.
Even if the Department is deleted, Teachers can still exist.
So, the relationship is aggregation.

     +-----------------+ â—‡â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€+----------------+
     |   Department    |                  |    Teacher     |
     +-----------------+                  +----------------+
     | - deptName      |                  | - name         |
     | - teacher       |                  | - subject      |
     +-----------------+                  +----------------+
     | + display()     |                  | + display()    |
     +-----------------+                  +----------------+

Here:
The hollow diamond (â—‡) is on the Department side.
The arrow line goes towards Teacher.
This means: Department HAS-A Teacher (aggregation).

Comparison with Composition:
Aggregation (â—‡ hollow diamond) â†’ independent life cycle.
Composition (â—† filled diamond) â†’ dependent life cycle (e.g., House HAS-A Room, if House destroyed â†’ Room destroyed).
