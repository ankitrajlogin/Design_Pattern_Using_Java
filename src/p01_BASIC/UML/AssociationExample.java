/*
 1. What is Association?
Association is the simplest relationship between two classes in OOP.
It represents a situation where objects of one class are connected to objects of another class.
It is a structural relationship (unlike dependency which is temporary).
Association does not imply ownership (unlike aggregation/composition).
ðŸ‘‰ In UML, itâ€™s shown as a plain solid line (â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€) between two classes.

2. Real-Life Example
A Student is associated with a Course.
A student can enroll in a course, and a course can have multiple students.
Both can exist independently.

3. Types of Association
One-to-One â†’ A person has a passport.
One-to-Many â†’ A department has many teachers.
Many-to-One â†’ Many employees work in one company.
Many-to-Many â†’ Students enroll in many courses, and courses have many students.


Important Points
Association just means "linked", not ownership.
It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.
Both classes can exist independently.
Association is often used in database modeling (ER diagrams â†’ later translated into UML).

/*
 âœ… Summary:
Association = a general connection between classes.
Represented by solid line in UML.
Example: Studentâ€“Course.
Independent lifecycles.
Can represent different multiplicities (1..1, 1..*, ..).
