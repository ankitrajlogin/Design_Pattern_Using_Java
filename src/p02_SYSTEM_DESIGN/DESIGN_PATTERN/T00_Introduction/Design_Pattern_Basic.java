/*
🎯 What is a Design Pattern?
👉 A Design Pattern is a proven solution to a common problem in software design.
- Think of it like a blueprint or template that developers can reuse, instead of reinventing the wheel every time.
- It’s not code itself, but a guideline on how to structure your code.

👶 In Simple Words:
Imagine you want to build a chair 🪑.
- You can design it from scratch (takes time, may break easily).
- Or you can use a chair-making template that’s been used for years (fast, reliable, works well).

That template = Design Pattern.

🛠️ Types of Design Patterns (3 main categories)
- Creational Patterns → Deal with object creation.
(e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder)

- Structural Patterns → Deal with class/object composition (how classes work together).
(e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)

- Behavioral Patterns → Deal with communication between objects.
(e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command)


✅ Benefits of Using Design Patterns
1. Reusability
Patterns provide ready-made solutions that can be reused in different projects.

2. Maintainability
Code becomes easier to maintain and extend because it follows a known structure.

3. Scalability
Applications can grow without becoming a mess.

4. Communication
Developers can say "This class uses Factory Pattern" → everyone understands instantly.

5. Reduced Errors
Since patterns are tested and proven, they reduce bugs in complex projects.

6. Faster Development
No need to “re-invent the wheel.”
