# 🎯 What is a Design Pattern?

👉 A Design Pattern is a proven solution to a common problem in software design.

Think of it like a blueprint or template that developers can reuse, instead of reinventing the wheel every time.

It’s not code itself, but a guideline on how to structure your code.

---

## 👶 In Simple Words:

Imagine you want to build a chair 🪑.

You can design it from scratch (takes time, may break easily).

Or you can use a chair-making template that’s been used for years (fast, reliable, works well).

That template = Design Pattern.

## 🛠️ Types of Design Patterns (3 main categories)

- **Creational Patterns** → Deal with object creation.  
  (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder)

- **Structural Patterns** → Deal with class/object composition (how classes work together).  
  (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)

- **Behavioral Patterns** → Deal with communication between objects.  
  (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command)

---

## ✅ Benefits of Using Design Patterns

- **Reusability**  
  Patterns provide ready-made solutions that can be reused in different projects.

- **Maintainability**  
  Code becomes easier to maintain and extend because it follows a known structure.

- **Scalability**  
  Applications can grow without becoming a mess.

- **Communication**  
  Developers can say *"This class uses Factory Pattern"* → everyone understands instantly.

- **Reduced Errors**  
  Since patterns are tested and proven, they reduce bugs in complex projects.

- **Faster Development**  
  No need to *“re-invent the wheel.”*

# 🏗️ Major Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are grouped into three families depending on what they solve:

---

## 1️⃣ Creational Design Patterns

👉 Focus on **object creation** – controlling how and when objects are created.  
Without them, you might create too many unnecessary objects or tightly couple your code.

### Examples:
- **Singleton** → Only one instance of a class (e.g., Database connection, Logger).
- **Factory Method** → Creates objects without exposing the creation logic.
- **Abstract Factory** → Creates families of related objects (e.g., GUI themes: Dark, Light).
- **Builder** → Step-by-step object construction (e.g., building a complex object like a Car).
- **Prototype** → Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones.

### 👶 Simple Analogy:
- **Singleton** → One government for the whole country.
- **Factory** → Restaurant kitchen makes food on order.
- **Builder** → Building a house room by room.
- **Prototype** → Photocopy machine making a duplicate.

---

## 2️⃣ Structural Design Patterns

👉 Focus on **class and object composition** – how different classes/objects work together.  
They help make systems more **flexible and extensible**.

### Examples:
- **Adapter** → Converts one interface into another (like a power adapter: 2-pin → 3-pin).
- **Decorator** → Add new functionality to an object without changing its structure (like adding extra toppings on pizza 🍕).
- **Facade** → Provides a simplified interface to a complex system (like TV remote for complex TV internals).
- **Proxy** → A placeholder object that controls access (like a lawyer speaking on behalf of a client).
- **Composite** → Treats a group of objects the same as a single object (like folders and files in Windows Explorer).
- **Bridge** → Decouples abstraction from implementation (e.g., separating device from remote control).

### 👶 Simple Analogy:
- **Adapter** → Charger plug converter.
- **Decorator** → Coffee with milk, sugar, cream (enhancements).
- **Facade** → One receptionist handling many departments.
- **Proxy** → Security guard checking before you enter.
- **Composite** → Folder contains files + other folders.

---

## 3️⃣ Behavioral Design Patterns

👉 Focus on **communication between objects** – how they interact and share responsibilities.  
They make code more **flexible and reusable**.

### Examples:
- **Observer** → One-to-many dependency. When one object changes, others get notified (e.g., YouTube notification system).
- **Strategy** → Define a family of algorithms, make them interchangeable (e.g., payment methods: Credit Card, UPI, PayPal).
- **Command** → Encapsulates a request as an object (e.g., Undo/Redo functionality).
- **Iterator** → Sequentially access elements of a collection without exposing internal structure (e.g., looping through a list).
- **Mediator** → Simplifies communication between multiple objects (e.g., air traffic control tower).
- **Template Method** → Defines skeleton of an algorithm, lets subclasses define steps (e.g., preparing tea vs coffee).
- **State** → Object changes behavior when its state changes (e.g., vending machine: hasMoney → dispense → idle).

### 👶 Simple Analogy:
- **Observer** → You follow a YouTube channel, get notifications when new video is posted.
- **Strategy** → You pick Uber payment method (cash/card/UPI).
- **Command** → Pressing a TV remote button (encapsulated command).
- **Iterator** → Turning book pages one by one.
- **Mediator** → Teacher mediating between two fighting students.
- **Template Method** → Recipe with fixed steps, but ingredients vary.
- **State** → Traffic light changes behavior depending on its current color.

## Other Major Design Pattern Categories

---

### 1️⃣ Concurrency (or Multithreading) Patterns

👉 Focus on handling **multi-threaded programming, synchronization, and resource sharing**.  
These aren’t part of the original GoF 23 patterns but are widely used in Java.

### Examples:
- **Thread Pool** → Reuse a fixed pool of threads instead of creating new ones every time.
- **Producer-Consumer** → Manage tasks between producer threads and consumer threads safely.
- **Read-Write Lock** → Multiple readers, single writer synchronization.
- **Future/Promise** → Placeholder for a result that will be available in the future.

### 👶 Analogy:
- **Thread Pool** → Instead of hiring new delivery boys every time, Swiggy reuses the same set of delivery agents.
- **Producer-Consumer** → Factory (producer) produces goods, shop (consumer) sells them.

---

## 2️⃣ Architectural Patterns

👉 High-level patterns for designing **large software systems**.  
They go beyond classes/objects and focus on **overall software architecture**.

### Examples:
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** → Separates data (Model), UI (View), and logic (Controller).
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** → Common in Android/Frontend apps.
- **Microservices** → Break system into independent services.
- **Layered Architecture (N-tier)** → Divide system into layers (UI, business logic, data access).
- **Event-Driven Architecture** → Components communicate via events.

### 👶 Analogy:
- **MVC** → Restaurant: Chef = Model, Waiter = Controller, Menu = View.
- **Microservices** → Each food stall sells its own dish independently.

---

## 3️⃣ Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)

👉 Used in **enterprise systems** where multiple applications need to communicate.

### Examples:
- **Message Queue (MQ)** → Store and forward messages between services.
- **Service Locator** → Central registry to find services.
- **Data Mapper** → Maps data between database and objects.

### 👶 Analogy:
- **Message Queue** → Post office stores and delivers letters later.
- **Service Locator** → Like a phone directory for finding people.

---

## 4️⃣ Anti-Patterns (Opposite of Design Patterns)

👉 These are **bad solutions** that look fine at first but cause long-term issues.

### Examples:
- **God Object** → One class does everything.
- **Spaghetti Code** → Code with no structure, hard to maintain.
- **Golden Hammer** → Always using the same solution (e.g., always forcing Singleton).
