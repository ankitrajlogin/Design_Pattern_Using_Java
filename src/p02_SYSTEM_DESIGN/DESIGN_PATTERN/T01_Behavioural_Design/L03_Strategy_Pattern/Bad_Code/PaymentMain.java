/*
🔹 Strategy Pattern
📌 Definition

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

➡️ In simple words: Instead of writing multiple if-else statements for different behaviors, we encapsulate each behavior in its own class and switch them at runtime.

📌 Real-Life Example

Imagine you are making a Payment System for an e-commerce website.

A customer can pay using Credit Card, PayPal, or UPI.

Without Strategy Pattern → You’d probably write big if-else or switch-case in the PaymentService.

With Strategy Pattern → Each payment method is its own class (algorithm), and the user can select/change it at runtime.

🔹 When to Use Strategy Pattern?

When you have multiple ways of doing the same task (e.g., payment, sorting, navigation).

When you want to avoid huge if-else or switch blocks.

When you need to switch algorithms at runtime without changing client code.

class PaymentService {
    public void pay(String method, double amount) {
        if (method.equals("CreditCard")) {
            System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
        } else if (method.equals("PayPal")) {
            System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal.");
        } else if (method.equals("UPI")) {
            System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using UPI.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid payment method!");
        }
    }
}

public class PaymentMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentService ps = new PaymentService();
        ps.pay("CreditCard", 500);
        ps.pay("PayPal", 1000);
    }
}


/*
❌ Problems:
Violates Open-Closed Principle (OCP) → Adding a new method requires modifying pay().
Difficult to maintain when many payment methods exist.
