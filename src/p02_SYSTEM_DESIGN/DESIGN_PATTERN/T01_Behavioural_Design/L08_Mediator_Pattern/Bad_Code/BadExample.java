/*
üéØ Mediator Pattern
üìò Definition:
Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that reduces the chaotic dependencies between multiple objects.
Instead of objects talking directly to each other, they communicate through a Mediator (a central controller).



üìù Problem Statement:
In an Air Traffic Control System (ATC), multiple airplanes need to coordinate when taking off and landing.

‚ùå Without a mediator:
    - Each airplane talks directly with every other airplane to check if the runway is free.
    - This creates complex dependencies (every airplane needs to know about all others).

‚úÖ With a mediator (ATC tower):
    - Airplanes don‚Äôt talk to each other directly.
    - They communicate only with the ATC tower, which acts as the mediator.
    - ATC decides which plane can take off or land.

/*
üî¥ Problems:
    - Airplanes need to know about each other directly.
    - Adding a new airplane = updating all others.
    - Hard to manage complex coordination (landing + takeoff).
