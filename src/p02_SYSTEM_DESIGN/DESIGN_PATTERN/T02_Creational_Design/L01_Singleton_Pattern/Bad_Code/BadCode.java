/*
üîë Singleton Pattern
üìò Definition:

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the program and provides a global point of access to it.

 */


/*
In many applications, some classes must have only one instance throughout the lifecycle.

Example scenarios:
    - Logger: only one logger should write to the log file, otherwise multiple loggers could overwrite each other‚Äôs logs.
    - App Settings / Config: API keys, DB URLs, etc. should exist in one place. If multiple copies exist, they may hold different values ‚Üí inconsistency.
    - Database Connection: Only one connection pool should exist to avoid resource overuse.

‚ö†Ô∏è If we allow multiple instances:
    1. Inconsistent state: different objects may hold different configurations.
    2. Resource conflicts: multiple loggers writing to the same file ‚Üí corruption.
    3. Performance issues: imagine each object uses 100MB memory; if 5 objects are created ‚Üí 500MB wasted.

So we need a way to guarantee one single instance.
That‚Äôs what the Singleton Pattern solves.

    }

        System.out.println(settings1 == settings2);  // false (two different objects!)
        System.out.println(settings1.getApiKey());

/*
‚ùå Problems
    - Two different objects (settings1 and settings2) are created.
    - They consume memory unnecessarily.
    - If setters were allowed, they could hold different values ‚Üí inconsistent state.
