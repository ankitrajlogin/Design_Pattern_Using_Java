/*
 ðŸ”¹ Explanation of Steps
 Step 1: ``` private static volatile ThreadSafeLogger instance; ```
 What it is:
     - private â†’ No outside class can directly access it.
     - static â†’ Belongs to the class itself (not objects), so only one copy exists in JVM.
     - volatile â†’ Ensures that when multiple threads read/write this variable, they always see the latest value.Without volatile, one thread might see a half-initialized object due to instruction reordering.

 Why needed?
    - Prevents memory consistency issues in multithreaded environments.

 Related term:
    - Volatile Keyword â†’ Guarantees visibility of changes across threads.
 Shared Memory Problem â†’ Without volatile, threads might read stale values from CPU cache.



 Step 2: ``` private ThreadSafeLogger() {} ```

 What it is:
    - Private constructor ensures that no external class can instantiate the logger using new.

 Why needed?
    - Enforces that the only way to create/get an instance is via getInstance() method.

 Related term:
    - Encapsulation â†’ Restricting direct creation.
    - Singleton Principle â†’ Ensures one object only.




 Step 3: public static ThreadSafeLogger getInstance()
 What it is:
    - Provides a global access point to get the unique instance.

 Key Part â†’ Double-Checked Locking
 ```
 if (instance == null) {              // Check 1 (fast, avoids unnecessary locking)
     synchronized (ThreadSafeLogger.class) {   // Lock for thread safety
         if (instance == null) {      // Check 2 (ensures only one thread creates it)
             instance = new ThreadSafeLogger();
         }
     }
 }
 ```

    - First Check: Quick performance boost (most calls skip synchronization once instance is created).
 Synchronization: Only one thread can enter at a time, preventing multiple creations.
 Second Check: Even if two threads reach the outer check, only one creates the instance.

 Why needed?
    - Guarantees both lazy initialization (created only when needed) and thread safety.

 Related terms:
    - Double-Checked Locking â†’ Optimization for multi-threaded singletons.
    - Lazy Initialization â†’ Object created only when requested (not at class load time).
    - Critical Section â†’ The block of code inside synchronized.
