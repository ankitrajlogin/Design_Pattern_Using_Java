/*
üü¢ Problem Statement
We are building a board game (like Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, or N-Queens puzzle).

In this game, we often need to save the current state of the board for reasons such as:
1. Undo functionality ‚Äì If a player wants to undo a move, we must restore the board to its previous state.
2. Checkpointing ‚Äì Save the progress of the game at different moments.
3. Cloning for new players or branches ‚Äì Create a new copy of the board for experiments.

‚û°Ô∏è To achieve this, we need a way to create a copy (clone) of the board with all its pieces.

Shallow Copy ‚Äì Copies only outer object but shares references of nested objects.

Deep Copy ‚Äì Creates independent copies of nested objects (used in this example).
