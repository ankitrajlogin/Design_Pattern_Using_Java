/*
Flyweight Pattern Design
    - The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.
    - It separates intrinsic state (shared/common data) from extrinsic state (unique per object) to reduce object creation.

/*
Problem Statement
Suppose youâ€™re making a game with 1 million trees in a forest.
Each tree has:
    - type (e.g., Oak, Pine, Mango ðŸŒ³)
    - color
    - texture
    - x, y position (location on the map)
 */

// BAD CODE - No Flyweight

    private String type;     // Intrinsic
    private String color;    // Intrinsic
    private String texture;  // Intrinsic
    private int x;           // Extrinsic
    private int y;           // Extrinsic

        this.texture = texture;
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
