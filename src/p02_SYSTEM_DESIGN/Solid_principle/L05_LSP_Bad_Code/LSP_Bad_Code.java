/*
ðŸ”µ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
ðŸ‘‰ Definition (by Barbara Liskov):
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the applicationâ€™s behavior.

Or in simple terms:
âœ… If B is a subclass of A, then anywhere A is expected, we should be able to use B without weird side effects.

ðŸ”´ Why LSP is Important?
Ensures polymorphism works correctly.
Prevents broken inheritance hierarchies.
Promotes reliable substitution of subtypes.
Avoids runtime surprises (like exceptions or wrong behavior).

class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("I can fly!");

    @Override

        System.out.println("Sparrow flying...");

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostrich can't fly!");

public class LSP_Bad_Code {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Both are birds
        Bird sparrow = new Sparrow();
        Bird ostrich = new Ostrich();

        sparrow.fly() ;
        // ostrich.fly() ;
        // Ostrich is not Flyable, so we never expect it to fly
    }
}

/*
âš  Problem:
Ostrich is a Bird, but it cannot behave like one.
If some method expects a Bird and calls fly(), passing an Ostrich will break.


Why LSP is violated here?

- LSP definition: Subclasses should be substitutable for their parent classes without altering the correctness of the program.

In your code:
- Bird promises that every bird can fly().
- But when you substitute Bird with Ostrich, the method fly() breaks (it throws an exception).
- So, Ostrich is not a proper subtype of Bird.
This breaks LSP.
