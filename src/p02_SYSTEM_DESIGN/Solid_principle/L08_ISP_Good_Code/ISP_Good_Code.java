/*
ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways
- Fat Interface Problem â†’ Clients forced to implement methods they donâ€™t need.
- Solution â†’ Split into smaller, role-specific interfaces.
Benefits:
- Cleaner, more understandable code.
- No meaningless/empty/unsupported methods.
- Classes only depend on what they truly need.


ðŸ”§ How to Use ISP in Real Projects
In Java, instead of creating one big interface (e.g., Animal with fly(), swim(), run()), break it into specific capability interfaces (Flyable, Swimmable, Runnable).
In Spring Framework, youâ€™ll often see multiple small interfaces like CrudRepository, JpaRepository, etc., instead of one giant interface.
