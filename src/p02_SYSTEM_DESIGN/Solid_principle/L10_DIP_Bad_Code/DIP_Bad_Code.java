/*
What is DIP?
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states:
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

In simple terms:
Your business logic (high-level code) should not directly depend on specific implementations (low-level code).
Instead, both should depend on an interface/abstraction.
This makes code flexible, testable, and easier to extend.

Real-life Analogy
Imagine a music player app:
Bad Design üéß: The app directly uses Spotify API only. If Spotify shuts down or you want to switch to YouTube Music, you must rewrite everything.

Good Design üé∂: The app uses a MusicService interface. Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music ‚Üí all implement that. Now you can swap services easily without touching the app logic.

/*
‚ùå Problems:
- Tightly coupled ‚Üí UserService depends directly on MySQLDatabase.
- If you want to switch to PostgreSQL or MongoDB, you must modify UserService code.
- Violates Open/Closed Principle (OCP) too, because adding new DB types requires modification.
